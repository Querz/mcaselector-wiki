If you would like to contribute a translation, you can find the language files in
[resources/lang/](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector/tree/master/src/main/resources/lang). The files
are automatically detected and shown as the respective language option in the settings dropdown menu once they are
placed in this folder.
