To have a better overview of what's happening in your world, MCA Selector gives the option to enable customizable
overlays. Overlays can display single values per chunk in the form of a color gradient with a minimum and maximum value.

## Configuration

Overlays can be configured using `Tools --> Edit overlays`. By pressing the `N` key, it will switch to displaying
the next overlay type. When pressing `O` while displaying an overlay, it will rotate all overlays of this type. Only
when all values of an overlay are valid (e.g. minimum < maximum) and it is set to active it will be displayed in the
main window.
